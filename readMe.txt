This code was made by a student(me) and should be taken with a grain of salt!!!

I made this code, to ease my pain every time i need a linked list to hold diferent
typed of data structure. This Linked List holds POINTERS and not integers.

Be carefull when removing elements from the list, because you need to FREE them youself
